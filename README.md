# 🚀 Node.js REST API with PostgreSQL

This is a backend API built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **PostgreSQL**, using modern development tools like `dotenv`, `pg`, and `nodemon`. It includes basic API routing, centralized error handling, and automatic table creation for PostgreSQL on startup.

---

## 📦 Features

- 🌐 RESTful API built with Express
- 🗃️ PostgreSQL integration using `pg`
- 🔄 Auto-create user table on server start
- 🔐 Environment variable support via `.env`
- ❌ Centralized error handler middleware
- ♻️ CORS enabled for frontend integration
- 🐳 Easy Docker integration (PostgreSQL)

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### 1. 📥 Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
````

---

### 2. 📦 Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

---

### 3. ⚙️ Setup environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the root with the following content:

```env
PORT=3001

# PostgreSQL credentials
DB_USER=your_pg_user
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_DATABASE=your_database
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_PORT=5432
```

> ⚠️ Never commit your `.env` file to Git!

---

### 4. ▶️ Run the server

For development (auto-restarts on changes):

```bash
npm run dev
```

For production:

```bash
npm start
```

---

## 🔁 Example API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint     | Description                    |
| ------ | ------------ | ------------------------------ |
| GET    | `/`          | Test DB connection             |
| GET    | `/api/users` | Get all users (if implemented) |
| POST   | `/api/users` | Create a new user              |

---

## 🐘 PostgreSQL with Docker

To run PostgreSQL using Docker:

```bash
docker run --name postgres-db \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_password \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  -d postgres
```

Make sure your `.env` matches these credentials.

---

## 🧪 Testing the API

Use tools like:

* [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)
* `curl`
* Any frontend client (React, etc.)

Test database connection:

```bash
GET http://localhost:3001/
```

---

## 📄 Scripts

In your `package.json`, use:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "node index.js",
  "dev": "nodemon index.js"
}
```

Then run:

```bash
npm run dev   # For development
npm start     # For production
```

## 📌 Notes

* Keep your `.env` file safe — never push secrets to version control.
* Add authentication and validation layers before going to production.
* Consider adding unit tests and Swagger/OpenAPI docs later.
